<p><div class="bodyTitle">Adding Bookmarks</div><br>
<div class="bodytext">Ensure that you are logged into the system (the login button is located at the top right of the window) and click the "add" link from the toolbar, this will bring you to the add form.<br> <br>
Enter in the URL of the site you wish to add, the title you want the URL to be displayed under, a brief description of the link (if you want, this isnt necessary) and the tags - separated by  spaces - that you want this bookmark to be classified under, leave this blank if you are unsure what you want to classify the bookmark as, you can always update and change this later. If you want this link to be viewable by anyone who visits your site, leave the "Public" checkbox checked. If you want this bookmark only viewable by you, uncheck the box<br><br>
Click the "Add" button at the bottom of the form, and this bookmark will be added to your list
</div></p>

<p><div class="bodyTitle">Using Tags</div><br>
<div class="bodytext">Tags are the way you organize and sort your bookmarks in Insipid, they are essentially keywords used to group similar links together. Tags can be any single word that you choose and you can use as many tags as you want for each link. Each time you add a link with a new tag it will automatically be added to the Tag List table on the left hand side of the page.
</div></p>

<p><div class="bodyTitle">Using Bookmarklets</div><br>
<div class="bodytext">A bookmarklet is essentially a shortcut to adding a new bookmark and a great tool for quickly building up your links. To start usinga bookmarklet follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Login to Insipid</li>
<li>Click on "Bookmarklet", this will bring you to a page with a single link "Post this page"</li>
<li>Right click on this link, and click "bookmark this link" in Moz/Firefox or "Add to Favourites" in IE (shame on you for using IE!).</li>
<li>Thats it!</li>
</ol>
Now whenever you are on a page that you want to add to Insipid, simply select this bookmark and you will automagically be taken to Insipid's add bookmark page, the URL and Title already filled in for you. Add your description and tags, decide whether to make this a private link, click add and you are done. After you click add you will be taken back to the page you just bookmarked.
</div></p>

<p><div class="bodyTitle">RSS Feeds</div><br>
<div class="bodytext">To subscribe to a specific users list of bookmarks, add the XML page to whichever feed reader you are using. To find out more about <a href="http://www.whatisrss.com/">RSS click here</a>
